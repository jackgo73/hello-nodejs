## Exercises

1 Select the last name of all employees.

```sql
SELECT LastName FROM Employees;
```

2 Select the last name of all employees, without duplicates.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TO_CHAR(LastName) FROM Employees;
```

3 Select all the data of employees whose last name is "Smith".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE TO_CHAR(lastname)='Smith';

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE dbms_lob.compare(lastname, 'Smith') = 0;
```

4 Select all the data of employees whose last name is "Smith" or "Doe".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE TO_CHAR(lastname)='Smith' OR TO_CHAR(lastname)='Doe';
```

5 Select all the data of employees that work in department 14.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 14;
```

6 Select all the data of employees that work in department 37 or department 77.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE lastname like 'S%';
```

8 Select the sum of all the departments' budgets.

```sql
SELECT SUM(budget) FROM departments;
```

9 Select the number of employees in each department (you only need to show the department code and the number of employees).

```sql
SELECT department,COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department; 
```

10 Select all the data of employees, including each employee's department's data.

```sql
SELECT SSN,
       E          . NAME AS Name_E,
       LastName,
       D          . NAME AS Name_D,
       Department,
       Code,
       Budget
  FROM Employees E
 INNER JOIN Departments D
    ON E.Department = D.Code;

```

11 Select the name and last name of each employee, along with the name and budget of the employee's department.

```sql
SELECT E.NAME AS Employees_Name,
       E.LastName AS Employees_LastName,
       D.NAME AS Departments_Name,
       D.Budget AS Departments_Budget
  FROM Employees E
  LEFT JOIN Departments D
    ON E.Department = D.Code;

```

12 Select the name and last name of employees working for departments with a budget greater than $60,000.

```sql
-- 不要使用left join .. on .. and budget > 60000 ，否则不合条件的行会当做null拼接到后面。
SELECT E.NAME AS Employees_Name, E.LastName AS Employees_LastName, D.Budget
  FROM Employees E
 INNER JOIN Departments D
    ON E.Department = D.Code
   AND D.Budget > 60000;

```sql

  from departments
 where budget > (select avg(budget) from departments);
```

14 Select the names of departments with more than two employees.

```sql
-- where 子句的作用是在对查询结果进行分组前，将不符合where条件的行去掉，即在分组之前过滤数据，条件中不能包含聚组函数，使用where条件显示特定的行。
-- having 子句的作用是筛选满足条件的组，即在分组之后过滤数据，条件中经常包含聚组函数，使用having 条件显示特定的组，也可以使用多个分组标准进行分组。

SELECT Name
  FROM Departments
 WHERE Code IN (SELECT Department
                  FROM Employees
                 GROUP BY Department
                HAVING COUNT(*) > 2);

 INNER JOIN Departments
    ON Department = Code
 GROUP BY Departments.Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

          FROM (SELECT code, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY budget ASC) rnk
                  FROM departments)
         WHERE rnk = 2)
```

16 Add a new department called "Quality Assurance", with a budget of $40,000 and departmental code 11. Add an employee called "Mary Moore" in that department, with SSN 847-21-9811.
